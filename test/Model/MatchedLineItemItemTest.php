/**
 * Klippa Custom OCR API
 *
 * # Introduction The Klippa Custom OCR Webservice API is a REST webservice for custom OCR implementations by Klippa.  The service replies are JSON only.  The service base URL is https://custom-ocr.klippa.com/api/v1. The service base URL for the test environment is https://test.custom-ocr.klippa.com/api/v1, we test experimental templates and features there. It also hosts the demo interface.  # Authentication ## APIKeyHeader The API requires the following header to be set:  Header | Description | --- |--- |   X-Auth-Key  |  The auth key provided by Klippa. |  The Key is provided per customer by Klippa.  ## APIKeyQueryParam The key can also be provided in the request query as ```?X-Auth-Key=key```  ## APIPublicKeyHeader The Public API requires the following header to be set:  Header | Description | --- |--- |   X-Auth-Public-Key  |  The public auth key provided by Klippa. |  ## APIPublicKeyQueryParam The key can also be provided in the request query as ```?X-Auth-Public-Key=public-key```   # Calling the API from public applications If you want to call the API from a public application, like a mobile app, you should **NOT** embed your API key in the app, this key could be extracted and abused.  The way to do this is using our API to [generate a public key](#operation/createPublicKey) from your backend, and send that public key to your application. That way only users that are authenticated are allowed to call the API. That way you can also better monitor which users are using the API and prevent abuse. You can also configure the public key to be valid for a certain time and give a maximum amount of scans.  The public key API is not available for every API key, we have to enable this for you.  We also have a [complete scanner SDK for Android and iOS](https://www.klippa.com/en/ocr/ocr-sdk/) available that has this API integrated.  The Public API requires the following header to be set:  Header | Description | --- |--- |   X-Auth-Public-Key  |  The public auth key provided by Klippa. |  The key can also be provided in the request query as ```?X-Auth-Public-Key=public-key```   # API Client libraries  Language | Client | --- |--- |   Go  |   [go.tar.gz](/docs/static/clients/go.tar.gz) |   Java  |   [java.tar.gz](/docs/static/clients/java.tar.gz) |   PHP  |   [php.tar.gz](/docs/static/clients/php.tar.gz) |   Python  |   [python.tar.gz](/docs/static/clients/python.tar.gz) |   Typescript (Axios)  |   [typescript.tar.gz](/docs/static/clients/typescript.tar.gz) |   Swift 3  |   [swift3.tar.gz](/docs/static/clients/swift3.tar.gz) |   Swift 4  |   [swift4.tar.gz](/docs/static/clients/swift4.tar.gz) |   # Error codes ## Authentication errors  Code | Name | --- |--- |   100001  |   ErrorCodeAuthMissingKey |   100002  |   ErrorCodeAuthInvalidKey |   100003  |   ErrorCodeAuthError |   100004  |   ErrorCodeAuthNoCreditsLeft |   100005  |   ErrorCodeAuthInvalidPublicKey |   100006  |   ErrorCodeAuthPublicKeyNoScansLeft |   100007  |   ErrorCodeAuthPublicKeyExpired |   ## PDF Parser errors  Code | Name | --- |--- |   200001  |   ErrorCodePDFParserDocumentError |   200002  |   Obsolete |   200003  |   Obsolete |   200004  |   ErrorCodePDFParserNoAccessToTemplate |   200005  |   ErrorCodePDFParserConvertError |   200006  |   ErrorCodePDFParserParseError |   ## Document Parser errors  Code | Name | --- |--- |   300001  |   ErrorCodeDocumentParserDocumentError |   300002  |   Obsolete |   300003  |   Obsolete |   300004  |   ErrorCodeDocumentParserNoAccessToTemplate |   300005  |   ErrorCodeDocumentParserConvertError |   300006  |   ErrorCodeDocumentParserParseError |   300007  |   ErrorCodeDocumentParserTooBigFileError |   ## Public Key errors  Code | Name | --- |--- |   400001  |   ErrorCodePublicKeyNotAllowed |   400002  |   ErrorCodePublicKeyCreationFailed |   400003  |   ErrorCodePublicKeyInvalidScanLimit |   400004  |   ErrorCodePublicKeyInvalidValidTime |   400005  |   ErrorCodePublicKeyLoadError |   400006  |   ErrorCodePublicKeyNotFoundError |  # Userdata  The user_data field allows for sending additional data into the parser and can be used to improve the recognition rate and processing speed. The user_data must be given as a JSON-encoded string. All fields are optional, a documents may be submitted without this field.  The following fields are accepted in the user_data object:  Key | Value type  | Description | --|--|--| `client`| `Relation` object | A relation object containing information about the client that submits the document. It should contain information either the merchant of the customer of the invoice. This is indicated by the `transaction_type` key. If the `transaction_type` is set to `purchase`, the client is considered to be the customer. If the `transaction_type` is set to `sale`, the client is considered to be the merchant. `transaction_type`  | string  | The transaction type of the document for the client. If the invoices contains a sale that the client made, this field can be set to `sale`. If the invoice contains a purchase that the client made, this field can be set to `purchase`.| `relations`  | array of `Relation` objects  | An optional list of relations which have previously been used by the client. The list does not have to be complete, the OCR may suggest merchants and customers which are not in this list. | `locale`| `Locale` object | If the language or originating country of the document is known, these values may be set.   ## Relation object  The relation object may contain the following fields. All fields are optional and may be omitted if a field is not available.
